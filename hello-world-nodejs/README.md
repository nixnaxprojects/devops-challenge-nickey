# Hello World Nodejs

`/hello` - Should return hello world

# Challanges

- Running locally with `npm run start` I can hit the `/hello` endpoint. In the docker container I can see the process is running but I always get `connection refused`
- My docker builds seem slower than they should be... and my docker images are very large
- Is my dockerfile good for production?
